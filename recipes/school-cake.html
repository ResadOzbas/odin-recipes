    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g butter, softened, plus extra for the tin</li>
        <li>200g caster sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>200g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>50ml milk</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>200g icing sugar</li>
        <li>coloured sprinkles</li>
        <li>hot custard, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter a 20 x 30cm cake tin and line with baking parchment. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat with an electric whisk for a few minutes until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, flour, milk and vanilla and beat again until you have a smooth batter.</li>
        <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared tin, spread right to the corners and smooth the surface. Bake for 40-45 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean, checking at 5 min intervals if it isn't ready after 45 mins. Leave the sponge to cool on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Mix the icing sugar with enough water to make a thick icing. Spread the icing over the cooled cake, then top with lots of sprinkles â€“ the surface should be almost completely covered. Leave for at least 1 hr to set. Cut into squares and serve with hot custard, if you like.</li>
    </ul>
